# EPQ Diary

##### 14/12/16
I have begun working on a prototype for my Ray Tracer, in order to test if the project is feasible whilst it is being approved by my supervisor. It will render basic spheres in a hard coded scene.

##### 18/12/16
So far, development on the prototype has been going well I've been able to accurately render spheres with reflections and corrrect calculations of the geometry and intersections, this gives me confidence that my project will be feasible and a better insight into which tasks will require the most effort to complete.

##### 02/01/17
Using information gained from the prototype, I have begun to think about dividing the project into separate manageable tasks which will all contribute to the final product. In order to manage my workflow, I used the website GanttPro to generate a Gantt chart which I can use to work against the final report deadline and measure how well I am keeping up with progress. For smaller tasks, I intend to maintain a TODO-list on paper which I will use to structure the tasks from the Gantt chart.

##### 06/01/17
Today I completed my project review, my supervisor approved of my project proposal and I plan on continuing the project as planned.
