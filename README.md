# Building a functional 3D ray tracer using physically based rendering techniques.

## Introduction

In the modern world we are constantly surrounded by realistic computer generated imagery. From incredibly realistic films with awe-inspiring graphics to real-time immersive video games which provide a temporary escape into virtual reality. Out of the top 10 grossing games of 2015, are based on a virtual 3D environment<sup>[[3](#3)]</sup> and would have dedicated developers working on rendering systems. The selling point of these ventures is the depth of realism which they offer<sup>[[4](#4)]</sup>  and, in recent years, this has really been a major market pull for research into more efficient rendering techniques resulting in exciting developments in the field<sup>[[5](#5)]</sup>.

Behind the scenes, these renderers have a high variety of techniques they employ in order to capture the environment as we see it. They model the interaction of light rays with a whole host of materials with increasing degrees of accuracy. In this project, I plan to investigate how these techniques are used achieve results by building my own ray tracer from scratch and evaluating how well it can render compared to existing implementations.
